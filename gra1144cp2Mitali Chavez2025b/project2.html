      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make Dough: Cut butter into 1-tbsp slices and place in a stand mixer. Add flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix on low-medium speed for 1 min. Slowly add milk, then knead on medium speed for 5 minutes until dough is soft and slightly tacky (poke test or windowpane test to check).</li>
        <li>Rest Dough: Shape dough into a ball and place on a floured surface. Flatten and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape Dough: Roll dough into a 14x10-inch rectangle. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Make Butter Layer: Beat butter and flour until smooth. Spread into a 7x10-inch rectangle on a lined baking sheet. Chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Laminate Dough: Place chilled butter in the center of the dough. Fold dough over butter, then roll out to a 10x20-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds (first turn). Chill for 30 minutes if needed. Repeat rolling and folding for 2 more turns (second and third turn). Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Shape Croissants: Roll dough into an 8x20-inch rectangle. Slice into 16 small rectangles. Stretch each one to 8 inches, fill with chocolate, and roll up tightly. Place on 2 lined baking sheets, cover, and rest at room temperature for 1 hour, then chill for 1 hour or up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Bake: Preheat oven to 400&deg;F (204&deg;C). Brush croissants with egg wash and bake for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. If needed, reduce heat to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Cool on a wire rack, dust with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
